Sorry guys, update coming soon! Patch Notes:

Update 3.4 

Bug fixes and more Download speed. Make sure if it says an internet problem, reload your router. Will NOT download on personal hotspots on your mobile device.
Download will fail using mobile Hotspot. Your router will NOT work if you have internet Blocks. Blocks such as Circle, Gryphon Care.
do not use XfinityFi or Xfinity Wifi 1 as this can result in failure. If you do use Xfinity wifi (which you can) i would reccommend turning off then back on
your router. Restart your rourter first, and then use it. Xfinity Wifi will be slow. Update is not actually out yet. just coming soon. Scroll down to see update
link when available.
